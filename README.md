# instagram_clone

An Instagram clone using MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Nodejs).

This project is developed on a local MongoDB database.

## To demo:
  - Clone to local machine
  - Run ```npm install``` in both client and server directories
  - Create a .env file in the server directory and format it as such: 
    - ```MONGODB_URI=[yourmongodburi]
         JWT_SECRET=yourjwtsecret```
    - Use your own MongoDB uri to connect to the app
    - The jwt secret can be any string of characters
  - Run ```npm start``` in client directory
  - Run ```npm run dev``` in server directory
  
  ### This is a work in progress and you may encounter app-breaking bugs depending on the current state of the project.
